```bash
This website was created to help people split the cost of restuarnt bills when eating out with friends. 
On this website, friends can add and edit the name of their friends dinning out with them, they can 
enter the bill and then choose to add a tip amount based on preference. Once the website has done 
the calculating for the tip amount, you can then add the the amount of friends and the website will then
split the cost entered depending on the amount of friends entered.
